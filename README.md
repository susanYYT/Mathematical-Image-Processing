### Multi-Label Classification by Semi-Supervised Singular Value Decomposition
Multi-label problems arise in various domains, including automatic multimedia data
categorization, and have generated significant interest in computer vision and machine
learning community. In this talk, we proposed to use a semi-supervised singular value
decomposition (SVD) to effectively capture the label correlations.
Experimental results for synthetic and real-world multimedia data sets demonstrate
that the proposed method can exploit the label correlations and obtain promising and
better label prediction results than the state-of-the-art methods.

### 磁共振成像图像处理中的数学问题
磁共振成像的技术瓶颈问题主要有两个：1）如何快速、廉价地获取图像，以降
低MRI检查成本，使得高通量检查或筛查成为可能；2）如何从图像中提取定量、个
体化的信息用于指导临床诊疗。这两个问题的最终解决都离不开数学。例如，稀疏
采样平行快速成像是近年来发展起来的、并已得到广泛应用的快速成像方法，而该
方法的实现在很大程度上依赖于压缩感知理论的提出和完善。著名数学家陶哲轩等
在这方面起到了决定性的作用。磁共振图像信息的提取目前主要依靠两种方法：放
射专家读片和基于统计方法的参数分析。前者可认为是个性化的信息提取，但在定
量性、客观性、可重复性等方面可能存在不足；后者是定量、客观的分析，但尚不
能高效实现个体化信息的提取。第二个瓶颈问题的解决需要数学不同分支的广泛参
与，包括偏微分方程、流体几何、图论、模式识别、网络分析、模型选择、数理统
计、复杂机器学习等。

### “Deep Revolution” in Image Restoration and Beyond
Deep learning continues to dominate machine learning. It is now widely used in
many research areas in science and engineering, and has major industrial impacts. Deep
learning methods have achieved remarkable results in a variety of tasks, especially in a
supervised learning environment. They have surpassed, or as good as, human in Go,
playing video games, accurately identifying objects in images and videos, diagnosing
certain diseases from medical images, etc.
In this talk, I will start with a brief review of classical (pre deep learning) image
restoration methods, followed by some recent applications of deep learning in image
restoration and image analysis. I will present my personal understanding of deep learning
in image restoration from the perspective of applied mathematics, which inspired two of
our recent work. One work is on combining numerical differential equation and deep
convolutional architecture design. In this work, we interpret some of the state-of-the-art
deep CNNs, such as ResNet, FractalNet, PolyNet, RevNet, etc., in terms of numerical
(stochastic) differential equations; and to propose new deep architectures that can further
improve the prediction accuracy of the existing networks in image classification. In the
other work, we proposed an end-to-end model for imaging based diagnosis in medical
imaging. Unlike traditional methods where image reconstruction and image recognition
are treated as two separate steps, our end-to-end model merges the two steps into one.
Our numerical experiments on a large scale real CT data set demonstrated the benefit of
the proposed method.
